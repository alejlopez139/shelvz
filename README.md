SHELVZ
------------------------------------
A website that allows you to sign in and start creating bookshelves. Once a bookshelf is created you can start to add books to your bookshelf. You can create nicknames for your bookshelf, and decide if other people can see your bookshelf.

We use the OpenLibrary API to get the info about the books. Once you have a book in your collection, you can change certain attributes, like saying if you recommend it,
if you favorite it, and if you want other people to see the book on your bookshelf.
